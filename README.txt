Click on Start Game should take you to Character Selection. Also I would like you guys to add to this project mess with the Character(i)Scenes to add the city or just move your current scenes and rename it to Character(i)Scenes. This is only temporary, if you guys want 4 characters we can, but I could also reduce this to 2. 

Victor - I would like you to make copies of your scenes copy current scenes and paste it and rename it t Character1Scenes and Character2Scenes because when you select a character it will jump to whatever scenes the character is in. Victor your Character will go into the Character2Scenes Since you are doing the boy.

Maria - Finish your character and put it into the Character1Scenes(We Could rename this to CharacterGirlScenes and CharacterBoyScenes)

I will contiune to update the menu as soon as the city is posted with the character we can all start to add functionality to the game, But we must do this as soon as we can.
